# Post-Mortem: Syntopix Project

## Overview

This project served as a foundational experiment to explore the development of a modular, scalable system using Vue.js and Redis. By adhering to spec-based incremental development, we achieved significant milestones, but we also encountered challenges that highlighted areas for improvement in collaboration, architecture, and organization.

## Accomplishments

### 1. **Spec-Based Incremental Development**

- Adopted a specification-driven approach to ensure clarity and alignment on objectives.
- Successfully implemented key features like drag-and-drop functionality and real-time data integration.
- Created foundational Vue components: Sidebar, MainContent, and App.vue.

### 2. **Redis Integration**

- Established backend services for managing Spaces and Topics in Redis.
- Leveraged Redisâ€™s data structures effectively to support features like persistent ordering and relational data.

### 3. **UI/UX Improvements**

- Implemented dynamic Topic and Space management with drag-and-drop capabilities.
- Enhanced form design and interaction with Vuetify components.

### 4. **Collaboration & Learning**

- Refined methods for effective spec-based development.
- Improved understanding of modular design, leading to a clearer direction for encapsulated components and services.

## Challenges

### 1. **Code Churn & Rework**

- Frequent iterations caused significant churn in code, especially with shared components.
- Redis-backed Vue integration was hampered by misaligned data structures and unclear responsibilities.

### 2. **Scaling Issues in Collaboration**

- Effectiveness decreased as the number of components and files increased.
- Lack of a standardized folder and file organization early on led to confusion.

### 3. **Redis Data Alignment**

- Inconsistent data structures in Redis led to issues with UI rendering and functionality.
- Ad hoc solutions sometimes conflicted with the overarching architectural goals.

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **The Value of Encapsulation**

- Encapsulating logic into modular components with dedicated data services simplifies debugging and reuse.
- Avoiding tightly coupled components reduces ripple effects from changes.

### 2. **The Importance of File Organization**

- A standardized folder structure (e.g., `/src/views/syntopix/spaces`) would improve maintainability and clarity.
- Each Vue component should have a corresponding data service file.

### 3. **The Need for Inventory**

- Leveraging previously working CLI and Vue code can reduce duplication and accelerate development.
- Maintaining an inventory of capabilities and reusable patterns ensures continuity.

## Next Steps

### 1. **Create a New Project**

- Establish a fresh project with the agreed-upon folder structure.
- Transfer reusable components and refactor them to align with the encapsulated design philosophy.

### 2. **Inventory & Redis Alignment**

- Conduct a full inventory of working CLI and Vue code.
- Standardize Redis data structures to support UI requirements.

### 3. **Develop Modular Components**

- Design plug-and-play Vue components with clear responsibilities.
- Ensure each component has a dedicated data service for Redis interactions.

### 4. **Finalize Specification**

- Refine and document the final UI/UX specification.
- Use the spec as a living document to guide development.

## Closing Thoughts

This project demonstrated the power and potential of spec-driven development but also highlighted the complexities of scaling such an approach. By adopting lessons learned and committing to better organization and modularity, the next phase of development can achieve even greater success.
